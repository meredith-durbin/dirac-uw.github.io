                <h2>DIRAC: Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology</h2>
                <p>
                The DIRAC Institute: The Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology Institute is a world     leading, interdisciplinary research center that addresses fundamental questions about the origins and   evolution of our universe.
                </p>

                <p>
                Our research brings together scientists across many disciplines on a mission to understand the nature   of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, the emergence of structure within the universe, the formation of    galaxies, the birth and evolution of black holes, the transformations of stars, and the origins of  the planets.    
                </p>

                <p>
                <a href="#lsst">The LSST</a> is a large optical survey project funded by the National Science
                Foundation and the Department of Energy. It will continually image the sky,
                identify changes in near real time, and over a decade of operations collect tens
                of petabytes of data building up the deepest, widest, image of the Universe.
                Its data will enable a range of science goals from identification of
                Near Earth Asteroids to understanding the nature of Dark Energy.
                </p>

                <p>
                From fundamental research on the most energetic events in the universe to the search for asteroids  that may one day impact the Earth, the science of the next decade will be driven by data. Our ability   to make scientific breakthroughs will be governed by our capacity to deal with the scale and        complexity of the data from a new generation of telescopes and experiments that will explore the    inner and outer reaches of our universe. DIRAC is creating an environment where scientists  harness     interdisciplinary expertise to solve some of the most difficult questions facing astronomy today; an    interaction space between Astrophysics, Computer Science, Statistics, and other disciplines.    </p>

          <h4>Science Pipelines</h4>
          <p>

        The <a href="http://ls.st/ug">LSST Science Pipelines</a> will implement the core image processing and data
        analysis algorithms needed to process optical survey imaging data at
        low latency and unprecedented scale and accuracy.  We are writing pipelines for
        single-epoch image processing, coaddition, image differencing,
        optimal multi-epoch measurements, and (global) photometric and
        astrometric calibration, among others.

          <h4>Scalable Database</h4>
          <p>

        To satisfy the need to efficiently store, query, and analyze catalogs
        running into trillions of row gs and petabytes of data, we are developing
        <a href="http://ls.st/kth">Qserv</a>, a distributed shared-nothing SQL database query system.

          <h4>User Interface</h4>
          <p>
        One of the most important jobs of a large survey is to provide access.
        This includes access to catalogs, processed images, and raw images.  Access in the next generation
        of surveys will extend to visualization and analysis.  We are writing interfaces
        that will allow thousands of users to query, download, visualize, and analyze petabytes of LSST data.

          <h4>Distributed Execution</h4>
          <p>
        The LSST data processing pipelines will need to efficiently scale from single core
        execution to tens of thousands of cores.  To meet this requirement we are building
        an orchestration framework to launch and monitor jobs on many different systems at
        many different scales.

    <h2>Getting the Code</h2>

    <p>The LSST data processing codes are being developed in an iterative, agile, fashion. Though engineering
    first light is still six years away, prototype versions of
    a number of LSST codes are already being
    tested on simulations and being applied to existing data (e.g.,
    <a href="https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/DC/Winter2013">reprocessing SDSS Stripe 82</a>,
    or <a href="http://subarutelescope.org/Projects/HSC/HSCProject.html">processing HSC Survey data</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
    While already state-of-the-art in many areas, LSST software is
    still in its infancy when it comes to end-user friendliness,
    documentation, and API stability.  There is no binary distribution yet
    &mdash; builds must be done from source.  Knowledge of Python (and
    willingness to write some Python code) are necessary to work with the
    current code base.

    </p>

    <p>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-inline btn-xs btn-outline-danger">Warning</button> <b>At this stage, the LSST software will be of greatest interest to the LSST Science Collaborations, large survey builders (or those reprocessing large survey data sets), and astronomical image processing enthusiasts.</b>

    If you're just looking to reduce a few observations
    with a ready-to-use tool, it may be better to look into one of the more
    polished and/or established packages such as <a
    href="http://www.astropy.org">AstroPy</a> or the <a
    href="http://www.astromatic.net/">AstrOmatic</a> suite.
    </p>

     <p>
         The DIRAC Institute and LSST group in the Astronomy department at the University of Washington have    openings for two postdoctoral or research scientist positions. These positions are to help with the     processing and analysis of data from the Zwicky Transit Factory (ZTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey     Telescope (LSST). The University of Washington is a new member of the ZTF collaboration, a time-    domain survey that will see first light in 2017 when it will scan over 3750 square degrees an hour to   a depth of 20.5-21 mag. As part of its contributions to ZTF, UW and the DIRAC Institute (a newly    established institute for data intensive survey astrophysics at the University of Washington) will  lead the development of a database for storing and serving transient and variable sources detected by   ZTF.

This ranges from studying the clustering of galaxies and their evolution with redshift, weak gravitational lensing of galaxies, and estimating the properties of galaxies based on their colors (aka photometric redshifts). The common theme to this work is addressing the need for massive data sets and how to work with them. One area that interests me a lot at the moment is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) where I lead the development of simulations of what LSST might observe. Beyond cosmology, I am also interested in how to make the technologies that companies use to search the internet useful in research and education.</p>
